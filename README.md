Introduction
====================
A pixel(mosaic) art casual game about catching emails based on Stage.js.

It's stupidly simple that there‚Äôs just one rule,

which a player uses the directional keys to catch more emails

as far as possible from the top down.

The game is over when the emails stack up to the top of the playing field.

In order to get more fun, you can replace the player texture with [Doge üêï]http://sunebear.github.io/Email-Catcher?role=doge) , [Yuukiti üêª]http://sunebear.github.io/Email-Catcher?role=yuukiti) or [Cosmo üê±]http://sunebear.github.io/Email-Catcher?role=cosmo).

In addition to fun, it has an important feature:

Racing with a simple scoring system.

Development Notes
====================
It's written in JavaScript(ES6),

built with Gulp and runs in modern browsers.

The path for core files of the game is `client/game`.

The web framework `SBW` is Work in Progress

and should be replaced with better framework

such as `React` and `Cycle`.

If you are viewing this repo,

I hope you don't judge me too harshly...

Maybe you need to read [Stage.js Documentation](http://piqnt.com/stage.js/)

that helps you understand more clearly.
